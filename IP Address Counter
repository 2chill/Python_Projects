# Create a program that takes an IP address enterd at the keyboard
# and prints out the number of segments it contains, and the length of each segment.
#
# An IP address consists of 4 numbers, seperated from each other with a full sttop. But
# your program should just count however many are enterd
# Examples if the input you may get are:
#    127.0.0.1
#    .192.168.0.1
#     10.0123456.255
#     172.16
#     255
#
# So your program shoud work even with invalid IP Addresses. We're just intersted in the
# number of segments and how long each one is.
#
# Once you have a woring programm here are some more suggestions for invalid input to test:
#     .123.45.678.91
#     123.4567.8.9
#     123.156.289.10123456
#     10.10t.10.10
#    12.9.34.6.12.90
#     '' - that is, press enter without typing anything
#
#
# !!!!! This challenge is intended to practice for loops and if/else statements. !!!!!
